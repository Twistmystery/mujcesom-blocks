# mujcesom-blocks
This is the raw code for various blocks developed for the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine during my web dev internship. The blocks work in a WordPress environment and are a part of a specially designed WordPress theme for the med school's updating website. Each folder contains information on the fields for the block created using the Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin (block.json) and the PHP to connect the ACF block (callback.php) to the twig files that control each block's front end (which are named in accordance to their corresponding folder).
