# mujcesom-blocks
This is the raw code for various blocks developed for the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine during my web dev internship. The blocks work in a WordPress environment and are a part of a specially designed WordPress theme for the med school's updating website named viridis. Each folder contains information on the fields for the block created using the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Pro plugin in the block.json file. The folders also contain the PHP needed to connect the ACF block to the twig to the twig files that control each block's front end in the callback.php. The majority of the logic and all the front end code are in the twig files located in the block-views folder, which are named in accordance to their corresponding folder.
